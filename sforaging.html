I designed this workshop as an adaptation of the Sensory walks I ran with Ethan Cohen. Instead of prompts I introduced a meditation to the start of the workshop. We then engaged with our olfactory senses and went on a walk/scavenge, collecting smells along the way to form scent sculptures.
In this sensory foraging workshop I encouraged participants to reflect on smell through the lens of associations, memory and emotion rather than feeling confined by a need to be able to describe a smell in a logical way.

    <i>Pestling Mortar</i> 
    
</br> "This project experiments with smudging roles between maker, viewer and participant. From Monday to Wednesday, a space will be set up by the students to allow from Thursday to Sunday those who visit the space can add to, change and inhabit the work through a series of formal and informal invitations.

<p>

    The work will be made in a collaborative unending process, points of production, realisation and dissolution. In this way of making there will be a rejection of the artworkâ€™s fallacy of staticness. Work will shift like fertile ground amongst new relational encounters. Some of our invitations may include the sensorial realms of sound, smell, performance, painting, and the virtual.
    
    <p>  
    
    Made on-site in constant change, the expectations of the gallery produced, received and removed will be replaced by a volatile act of un-preciousness. People entering the space will be equal actioners on the work as the starting artists.
    
    <p>
    
    It is a relational work that navigates the dissolution of the self in the gallery into the ongoing practice of relationality. It is not a contest of pursuing and buying the nicest bricks but about the quality, effectiveness and stickiness of the mortar that binds them."
