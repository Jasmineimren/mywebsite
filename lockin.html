      The second iteration of <b>Our Blood for Strawberry Laces</b>, origionally concieved for the group exhibition "gHost" takes on a new form for the Queer Art Rave 'Riposte'.
    </p>
    Jade Zaheer and Jasmine Imren have gone feral and maybe you have tooâ€¦. We emerge as pelicans; twins, mothers, daughters, friends, lovers. Subverting the christian iconography of the pelican of piety, who to feed her children in times of famine rips open her belly and sustains them with her blood. We instead rip apart our bellies to feed each other, and the audience with strawberry laces, in an ode to sustaining queer community as chosen family. Expect a feathery flight (and maybe a little something to eat).
