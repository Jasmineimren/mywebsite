        In my artistic practice, I blend performance, collaboration, and the exploration of sensory experiences, stepping beyond the confines of traditional gallery spaces to engage with art in its most ephemeral forms. Central to my practice is a fascination with olfaction as an artistic medium and utilising scentâ€™s underexplored emotional and mnemonic power. My work, often showcased in collective exhibitions, emphasises community and immersive experiences which connect with audiences both through the language of smell and the visceral impact of live performance to evoke immediate, instinctual reactions.
