        I work with performance, collaboration, and the sensory, engaging with the ephemeral. My projects blur into one another not usually having defined ends or final products but instead inform new iterations, evolutions, mediums and collaborators. The mediums I choose to work with similarly do not have defined end points, for example scent, which disperses into the space and clings to bodies, living on in unknown ways and realms. I have come to recognise power and agency in sensory spheres associated with the feminine and witchcraft: baking, potions, perfume, concocting. Cultural dismissal of olfaction is intrinsically linked to structures of marginalisation, making it a rich medium to disrupt cultural attitudes surrounding the body and its functions. I utilise scents underexplored emotional and mnemonic power to connect with audiences. I often seek out collective contexts, to emphasise immersive experiences that invite instinctual reactions. Transforming what is often deemed disgusting into a site for reflection, curiosity, and even play. Becoming animal and the blurring of the boundaries between animal and human is a recurring theme in my work, allowing me to escape the boundaries of my body and the expectations confined to it, expanding into imagined identities. Looking at collaboration conceptually allows me to probe the porousness of identity and explore how creating with others can disrupt fixed narratives. Queer community is important to me, as a theme central to my artwork and reflected in the friendships formed through the process of artistic collaboration.I tend to create in a way which is inherently site-specific, shaped in response to the environments in which my art occurs.
